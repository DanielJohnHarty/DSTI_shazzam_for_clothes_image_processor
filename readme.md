# Recommending Similar Images Based on a User Provided Image

As part of group challenge for master's degree data science and data engineering cohort, the cohort was split in to 3 groups with the objective of creating a working prototype of a Shazzam like application which takes user images of clothes and recommends similar clothes on sale at vinted.com or other online stores.

This repository is the shared repo of one of the teams, responsible for creating a muli-team shared api and create the reccomendation engine which would ultimately serve the (hopefully similar) images of clothes in response to a user image. 

The article_contribution.md file contains fraft text which will be a contribution to a paper or article presented by the master's group cohort.

This repository is related to ***https://github.com/DanielJohnHarty/DSTI_ShazzamForClothes***.

### Steps to setup:

1. `git clone https://github.com/DanielJohnHarty/DSTI_shazzam_for_clothes_image_processor.git`
2. `cd DSTI_shazzam_for_clothes_image_processor`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` **It's highly recommended to create a new python environment for this using Python 3.7**
4. Then run the script using a bash terminal with `sh main.sh`
